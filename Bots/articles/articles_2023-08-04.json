It's great to have a way to break out of my own insular research bubble and spread out a bit more. Unfortunately, it looks like that era has passed.\n\nThe sub has been seemingly shifting away from research in the past 1-2 years. Whenever research is posted, it is almost always LLM based with very little variety (considering the plethora of research areas in ML). I don't mean to assert that this is a bad thing, as the constant upvotes indicate that there is a high demand for LLM projects and research. Heck, I'm also interested in lots of the recent work with LLMs, and I plan to keep up with it \u2013 but I also would also love a venue with a diversity of ideas and topics. Machine learning is a HUGE field, and only focusing on a small subset of it seems like a waste.\n\nI don't mean to rant, but rather to ask: are there any other subreddits like this, or perhaps, any other active communities with a broader scope?\n\nOr if this doesn't exist, is there a demand for it? Or is it just me?",

                "text": "The purpose of this project was to increase transparency and simplicity regarding financial calculations. This is why this project contains the formulas of over 50+ financial ratios of which each has a seperate function ([example](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/blob/main/financetoolkit/ratios/profitability.py)). You can not only see how each metric is calculated but you have the complete freedom to decide what data you put in and how you use each metric. Here's why.\n\nBrowsing financial websites, I often saw that the same financial ratios can vary greatly per website. As an example, Morningstar says the Return on Equity of Microsoft is  18.63  whereas Yahoo Finance reports 14.83. Because the timing or underlying calculation can be off, finding a single truth can be difficult and even if you did want to figure this out, you often have to pay if the data is even available. I wanted to change that.\n\n[**Introducing the Finance Toolkit**](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit), an open-source toolkit in which all relevant financial ratios (50+), indicators and performance measurements are written down in the most simplistic way allowing for complete transparency of the calculation method. This allows you to not have to rely on metrics from other providers and, given any financial statement, allow for efficient manual calculations.\n\nA simple example (and definitely have a look at [**this notebook**](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceToolkit/blob/main/examples/Finance%20Toolkit%20-%201.%20Getting%20Started.ipynb) to understand what the Toolkit offers) :\n\n    from financetoolkit import Toolkit\n    \n    # Initalize the Toolkit\n    companies = Toolkit(['AAPL', 'MSFT'], api_key=\"FMP_KEY\", start_date='2017-12-31')\n    \n    # Obtain all Financial Ratios\n    companies.ratios.collect_profitability_ratios()\n\nWhich returns (for Apple):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kpznhumahifb1.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bab7e793b669bd8b08c477d27cd80d981fbcc392\n\nThese are the things currently included and I am constantly expanding it:\n\n* **Company profiles** (profile), including country, sector, ISIN and general characteristics (from FinancialModelingPrep)\n* **Company quotes** (quote), including 52 week highs and lows, volume metrics and current shares outstanding (from FinancialModelingPrep)\n* **Market cap and enterprise values** (enterprise), including every intermediate step (from FinancialModelingPrep)\n* **Company ratings** (rating), based on key indicators like PE and DE ratios (from FinancialModelingPrep)\n* **Historical market data** (historical\\_data), which can be retrieved on a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis (from Yahoo Finance)\n* **Balance Sheet Statements** (balance\\_sheet\\_statement),  **Income Statements** (income\\_statement), **Cash Flow Statements** (cash\\_flow\\_statement) and **Statistics Statements** (statistics\\_statement), obtainable from FinancialModelingPrep or the source of your choosing through custom input. These functions are accompanied with a normalization function so that for any source, the same ratio analysis can be performed. Please see this Jupyter Notebook that explains how to use a custom source.\n* **Efficiency ratios** (efficiency\\_ratios), **liquidity ratios** (liquidity\\_ratios), **profitability ratios** (profitability\\_ratios), **solvency ratios** (solvency\\_ratios) and **valuation ratios** (valuation\\_ratios) functionality that automatically calculates the most important ratios based on the inputted balance sheet, income and cash flow statements. Next to that, it is also possible to input your **own custom ratios** (custom\\_ratios).\n* Models (models) like **DUPONT analysis** that can be used to perform in-depth financial analysis through a single function.\n\nThis Toolkit works very well with the [Finance Database](https://github.com/JerBouma/FinanceDatabase), this is a database I shared with the community 5 months ago ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11lyyzb/i_made_a_finance_database_with_over_300000/)). This is a free database of over 300.000 companies,. With these two packages in hand, it becomes incredibly easy to identify companies in a sector or industry and then collect all financial statements and financial ratios in an instant.",

                "text": "I\u2019ve coded in C and C++ but I\u2019m far from an expert. I was interested to know if there any features in C that C++ includes, but could be better without? I think I heard somebody say this about C-style casts in C++ and it got me curious. \n\nNo disrespect to C or C++. I\u2019m not saying one\u2019s better than the other. I\u2019m more just super interested to see what C++ would look like if it didn\u2019t have to \u201csupport\u201d or be compatible with C. If I\u2019m making wrong assumptions I\u2019d love to hear that too!\n\nEdits:\n\nTo clarify: I like C. I like C++. I\u2019m not saying one is better than the other. But their target users seem to have different programming styles, mindsets, wants, whatever. Not better or worse, just different. So I\u2019m wondering what features of C (if any) appeal to C users, but don\u2019t appeal to C++ users but are required to be supported by C++ simply because they\u2019re in C.\n\nI\u2019m interested in what this would look like because I am starting to get into programming languages and would like to one day make my own (for fun, I don\u2019t think it will do as well as C). I\u2019m not proposing that C++ just drops or changes a bunch of features.\n\nIt seems that a lot of people are saying backwards compatibility is holding back C++ more than features of C. If C++ and C++ devs didn\u2019t have to worry about backwards compatibility (I know they do), what features would people want to be changed/removed just to make the language easier to work with or more consistent or better in some way?",

I have generic controllers with generic services based on \"generic\" DB entities. Of course this has its drawbacks but its also convenient when you have 50+ tables. \n\nStarted doing GO, love it, but...it has some weird for me quirks, for example this guy:\n\n[https://youtu.be/a6Q5KseZ47s?t=307](https://youtu.be/a6Q5KseZ47s?t=307)\n\nPuts all the calls to the DB in simple functions under the models themselves...and has to name them all, so for 50 + tables i would have to write 200+ function names FindAById FindBById FindCById etc. etc.\n\nIt seems...wrong, Same with the handlers, have to write the URL by hand instead of like .NET creating it automatically etc. etc. a lof manual work for every entity basically. Do i just have to change my mindset or am i missing something?",
