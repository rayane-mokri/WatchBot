It's great to have a way to break out of my own insular research bubble and spread out a bit more. Unfortunately, it looks like that era has passed.\n\nThe sub has been seemingly shifting away from research in the past 1-2 years. Whenever research is posted, it is almost always LLM based with very little variety (considering the plethora of research areas in ML). I don't mean to assert that this is a bad thing, as the constant upvotes indicate that there is a high demand for LLM projects and research. Heck, I'm also interested in lots of the recent work with LLMs, and I plan to keep up with it \u2013 but I also would also love a venue with a diversity of ideas and topics. Machine learning is a HUGE field, and only focusing on a small subset of it seems like a waste.\n\nI don't mean to rant, but rather to ask: are there any other subreddits like this, or perhaps, any other active communities with a broader scope?\n\nOr if this doesn't exist, is there a demand for it? Or is it just me?",

There\u2019s lots of legacy code there and they find it difficult to attract talent), and I was tasked to lead the migration effort and want to make sure I am on the same page with the industry and not inventing the wheel.\n\nMy plan is to continue what\u2019s been working successfully for me for the past 5 years almost:\nGo\nAWS with high reliance on managed services (lambda, eks, api gateway and authorizer, cognito/auth0)\nGin but decouple and abstract as much as possible\nNo ORM\nCode generation where possible (oapi-codegen, groc/twirp for RPC)\n\nI try to avoid frameworks as much as possible because I get lots of stuff such as caching, rate limiting and etc from my managed services (API gateway for example) and also want full control over my db queries and models.\n\nBut yet go-micro and other frameworks remain highly popular.\n\nWhat are your choices and thoughts? Yes, I know that keeping what\u2019s working is great but I\u2019m always open to improving my stack and tooling\n\nThanks,",
