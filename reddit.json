For that reason we are providing additional resources below that either exclusively focus on ml or often discuss ml:\n\n* ~~[taggernews](http://www.taggernews.com/tags/ai/machine%20learning/) - an ml powered classifier for [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) posts tagged as ai/ml~~\n* use [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) RSS feeds like this one to keep up with posted research https://hnrss.org/newest?q=arxiv+OR+cvpr+OR+aaai+OR+iclr+OR+icml+OR+neurips+OR+emnlp+OR+acl\n* reddit has rss feeds for just about any link by just adding `.rss` to the end of the url, so you can follow r/machinelearning using https://reddit.com/r/machinelearning.rss or even follow all posts that link to arxiv using https://reddit.com/domain/arxiv.org.rss\n* [lobste.rs/t/ai](https://lobste.rs/t/ai) - posts tagged as ai on [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/t/ai)\n* [m/machinelearning](https://kbin.social/m/machinelearning/) - a nascent space for ml discussion on [kbin](https://kbin.social)\n\nYou can also find a more thorough list of subs with additional resources here: https://sub.rehab\n\nIf you have additional resources you think would be useful, please comment below and we can add them to the list.\n\nEDIT: removed taggernews since its long defunct",

                "text": "Let's say I want to build a classification model.  \n\n\nSo, to find the best classification model, I will import all of sklearn's classifications algorithms, and test all of them, and test various hyperparameters for each model, and then choose the one that perfoms better on my data.  \n\n\nGiven the fact that the process to \"find the best model\" is just testing all models and their hyperparameters, what befenits do I have of having deep understanding of ML algorithms? I mean, even without knowledge of any algorithm, anyone can import all the algorithms, put in a pipeline and select the best.  \n\n\nI think that having deep understanding of the algorithms can lead to a better intuition of what would work or not, but since the only way to prove it is testing, I can't see that much value in it.  \n\n\nWhat am I missing?",

But any returns beyond that amount\u2014and if we are successful, we expect to generate orders of magnitude more value than we\u2019d owe to people who invest in or work at OpenAI LP\u2014are owned by the original OpenAI Nonprofit entity.\u201d  \nHow does an OpenAI offer work?  \nThere are two components to OpenAI\u2019s offer: the base salary and the \u2018equity,\u2019 which they call \u2018Profit Participation Units\u2019 or \u2018PPUs.\u2019 The base salary is standard and self-explanatory. It\u2019s the cash paycheck you get every two weeks.  \nThe profit participation units are where it starts to get confusing, as companies sometimes use profit participation or profit interest grants differently.  \nHere\u2019s a recent [OpenAI offer](https://www.levels.fyi/offer/6ab65752-a3f0-48ad-afc3-72ccb368d6ed) (see [all OpenAI offers here](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/openai/salaries/software-engineer)), where you can see a base salary of $300k/year with a $2M PPU grant that vests evenly over 4 years, bringing the yearly total compensation to $800k.\n\n[https://www.levels.fyi/blog/openai-compensation.html](https://www.levels.fyi/blog/openai-compensation.html)",
